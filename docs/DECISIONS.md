# Decisions

Short records of choices made while building out the platform. Newest last.

## D-001 Keep suffix-style names
Existing hub and image builder resources are named `<workload>-<env>-<region>-<abbr>`. CAF also allows abbreviation-first names, but renaming deployed resources means replacing them. The shared naming module keeps the existing pattern.

## D-002 Containerized toolchain on linux/amd64
The PowerShell base image (needed for PSRule) is published for amd64 only. The tooling image is pinned to `linux/amd64` and runs under emulation on Apple silicon. PSRule's Bicep expansion timeout is raised to 180 s to allow for it.

## D-003 Checkov scans compiled ARM, not Bicep
Checkov's Bicep parser fails on current syntax (user-defined types, imports, lambdas). `make scan` compiles each parameter file's deployment to `out/arm/` and Checkov scans the ARM JSON. CKV_DOCKER_2 (HEALTHCHECK) is skipped because the tooling image is a CLI.

## D-004 Image builder: lateral SSH/RDP deny, gallery what-if suppression
Added an outbound deny for TCP 22/3389 to `VirtualNetwork` on the build, ACI and private endpoint NSGs (the ACI subnet keeps an explicit allow to the build subnet). The `what-if-short-circuiting` warning on the gallery role assignment is suppressed: the principal ID is part of the existing assignment name, and changing it would recreate the assignment.

## D-005 Image builder storage stays LRS (PSRule Azure.Storage.UseReplication)
The account holds scripts and installers that the publish tools can recreate. Converting an existing account from LRS to ZRS is a separate migration, not a template change.
